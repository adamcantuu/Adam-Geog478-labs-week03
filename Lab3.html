    Worked 35+ hours a week. Lead an effort to update and maintain spatial data and associated 
    cartographic products for Public Works’ divisions including Streets, Drainage, Landscape, 
    Traffic, Facilities, and Irrigation. Identified new and existing street, drainage, traffic,
    facility, and irrigation infrastructure through rigorous field work and utilizing 
    aerial/satellite imagery. Leveraged GIS/GPS tools and principles to record relevant geospatial data. </p>

<p>“Covid: Spring Break vs. No Spring Break”<div></div>
    Collected covid data from the week after spring break for the specific counties that contained a university. 
    Chose to compare a college that didn't allow a full spring break, A&M, and a college that allowed a full spring break, UT.
    Used R Studio to compute some inferential statistics and a form of spatial analysis to ultimately decide if having a full 
    spring break or not had any effect on covid cases in the chosen counties.

       <p>“Wolf Pen River Differences in NAD27, NAD83 and ArcCollector”<div></div>
        ArcCollector was used to walk a portion of Wolf Pen River from Highway 6 to Texas Avenue. 
        This shapefile was taken from ArcGIS Online and transferred to ArcGIS Pro. Two other maps were created in ArcGIS Pro 
        with the two datums of NAD27 and NAD83. Two more shapefiles were created in the respected datums and then overlayed on 
        the shapefile with the ArcCollector coordinates.

   <p>“Best City for New MLB Team”<div></div>	
    Researched cities with major sports teams but no major baseball team. Took five cities in 5 different states and then 
    downloaded data from the United States Census Bureau to decide the best location for a new team. Applied median household 
    income, average household size, total population by county, and median male age to narrow down the best location. Created 4 
    choropleth maps in ArcGIS Pro displaying this data in the 5 different states to decide where the best location would be.

    <p>“Zoning for the City of Bryan, Texas”<div></div>
        Used data already obtained to zone the city of Bryan, Texas. These maps were created in ArcMap and then given 
        to a class at Blinn to help with a greater project. I had to apply the zoning areas to a satellite view of the 
        city and categorize them into their correct area. These maps were later used to help zone the city correctly.
